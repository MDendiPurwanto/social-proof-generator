It allows you to customize the position, duration, animation, background color, and content of the notifications, making it perfect for e-commerce, marketing, or service-based websites.

### Features
- **Customizable Position**: Choose from bottom-left, bottom-right, top-left, or top-right.
- **Animation Options**: Fade or slide effects for smooth transitions.
- **Randomized Messages**: Display random names and products for dynamic notifications.
- **Custom Styling**: Set background color and product image URL.
- **Page-Specific**: Notifications appear only on WordPress pages, not posts.
