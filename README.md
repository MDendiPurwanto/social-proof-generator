Social Proof Generator is a lightweight WordPress plugin that displays popup notifications to showcase recent purchases or interactions on your website's pages (not posts). It allows you to customize the position, duration, animation, background color, and content of the notifications, making it perfect for e-commerce, marketing, or service-based websites.

### Features

- **Animation Options**: Fade or slide effects for smooth transitions.
- **Randomized Messages**: Display random names and products for dynamic notifications.
- **Custom Styling**: Set background color and product upload image.
- **Page-Specific**: Notifications appear only on WordPress pages, not posts.
